# Hello-World
Git Hub Ice breaker


This is an introduction to GitHub for me. Github seems a very interesting project as what I have understood so far is that Github can be accessed anywhere over the internet and one can resume the codeing from where they left. For groups it gives features to make changes with descriptions as to what was changed and the reasons behind it.

I am very exited to use Git Hub for real life projects.
